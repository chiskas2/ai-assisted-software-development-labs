# Lab Exercise 1: Getting Started with Cursor

__Objective__: Learn the fundamental features of Cursor AI IDE and become comfortable with basic interactions.

## Prerequisites
- Cursor IDE installed on your computer
- Basic familiarity with code editing

## Exercise Overview
This lab will guide you through the essential features of Cursor, focusing on the core tools you'll use daily. Each section includes hands-on tasks with solutions that can be revealed if needed.

### Part 1: Basic Chat Interaction
Let's start by learning how to interact with Cursor's AI assistant.

1. Open a new file in Cursor and name it `hello.py`.
2. Open the Chat panel from the sidebar.
3. Try the following tasks:
   - Ask the assistant to write a "Hello, World!" program in Python
   - Ask it to explain how the code works
   - Ask it to modify the code to accept a user's name as input

Example chat interactions:

```
You: "Write a Hello World program in Python"
Assistant: Here's a simple Hello World program:

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

You: "Can you explain how this code works?"
Assistant: [Will explain the f-string and input function...]
```
</details>

### Part 2: Quick Questions
Practice using Quick Questions for immediate code-related queries.

1. Write or paste this simple function into your editor:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
```
2. Highlight the function and try these tasks:
   - Right-click and select "Ask Cursor" (or use the shortcut)
   - Ask "What could go wrong with this function?"
   - Ask "How can I make this function more robust?"

The assistant should point out:
- Division by zero error for empty lists
- No type checking
- Suggested improvements like error handling
</details>

### Part 3: CMD-K Fast Edits
Practice using CMD-K (or CTRL-K) for quick code modifications.

1. Create a new file called `calculator.py` with this code:
```python
def calc(x, y):
    return x + y
```
2. Complete these tasks using CMD-K:
   - Rename the function to `add_numbers`
   - Add parameter type hints
   - Add a docstring explaining what the function does
   - Add error handling for non-numeric inputs

<details>
<summary>Reveal Solution</summary>

After completing all tasks, your code should look similar to this:

```python
def add_numbers(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    """
    Add two numbers together and return the result.
    
    Args:
        x (float): First number to add
        y (float): Second number to add
    
    Returns:
        float: Sum of x and y
        
    Raises:
        TypeError: If inputs are not numeric
    """
    if not (isinstance(x, (int, float)) and isinstance(y, (int, float))):
        raise TypeError("Inputs must be numeric")
    return x + y
```
</details>

### Part 4: Terminal Integration
Learn to use Cursor's integrated terminal and Terminal CMD-K feature.

1. Open the integrated terminal
2. Try these tasks:
   - Create a new virtual environment
   - Install a Python package (e.g., `requests`)
   - Deliberately cause an error (e.g., type `python nonexistent.py`)
   - Use Terminal CMD-K to understand and fix the error

<details>

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# or (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install package
pip install requests

# Cause error
python nonexistent.py
# Use CMD-K to ask about the error
```
</details>

### Part 5: Using Cursor Chat’s “Apply”
Practice applying AI suggestions to your code.

1. Create a new file called `data_processor.py`
2. Copy this basic list processing function into it:
```python
def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        result.append(item * 2)
    return result
```
3. Complete these tasks:
   - Ask Cursor to convert this to a list comprehension
   - Use the Apply feature to implement the suggestion
   - Ask Cursor to add input validation
   - Apply the suggested changes

<details>
<summary>Reveal Solution</summary>

Final code should look similar to:

```python
def process_data(data):
    if not isinstance(data, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    return [item * 2 for item in data]
```
</details>

## Final Challenge
Combine all the features you've learned in a single task:

1. Create a new Python file called `text_analyzer.py`
2. Using Chat, Quick Questions, and CMD-K:
   - Create a function that counts words in a text file
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add documentation
   - Add type hints
   - Create a test case
3. Use the terminal to run your tests
4. Use Apply to implement any suggestions for improvement

<details>
<summary>Reveal Solution</summary>

```python
from typing import Dict
from pathlib import Path

def analyze_text(filepath: str | Path) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """
    Analyze a text file and return word frequency.
    
    Args:
        filepath: Path to the text file
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with words and their frequencies
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
        TypeError: If filepath is not str or Path
    """
    if not isinstance(filepath, (str, Path)):
        raise TypeError("Filepath must be string or Path")
        
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read().lower()
        words = text.split()
        return {word: words.count(word) for word in set(words)}

# Test case
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("hello world hello python")
    
    result = analyze_text("test.txt")
    print(result)  # Expected: {'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'python': 1}
```
</details>

## Wrap-up
By completing this lab, you should now be comfortable with:
- Using the Chat feature for code assistance
- Making Quick Questions about specific code
- Using CMD-K for fast edits
- Working with the integrated terminal
- Applying AI suggestions to your code

In the next lab, we'll explore more advanced features of Cursor that build upon these fundamentals.
