## Exercise 1: Your First v0 Component

In this exercise, you'll create your first component using v0's text-to-UI capabilities.

### Task
Create a contact form component with the following requirements:

1. Write a prompt for v0 to create a contact form that includes:
   - Name field (required)
   - Email field (required)
   - Subject dropdown (with options for "General Inquiry", "Technical Support", "Billing")
   - Message textarea
   - Submit button
   - Modern, clean design with proper spacing

### Steps

1. Visit [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) and sign in
2. Start a new chat session
3. Write your prompt. Here's a sample to get you started:
   ```
   Create a contact form with fields for name, email, subject (as a dropdown), 
   and message. Use a clean, modern design with proper validation and spacing. 
   Make it responsive and accessible.
   ```
4. Review the generated component
5. Try modifying your prompt to refine the design

### Success Criteria
- The form should be responsive (changes layout based on screen size)
- All fields should have proper labels and validation
- The design should be clean and professional
- The component should include proper error states

## Exercise 2: From Sketch to UI

In this exercise, you'll convert a hand-drawn wireframe into a polished UI component, styled according to inspiration from an existing website.

### Prerequisites
- Paper and pen/pencil for sketching
- Phone camera or scanner for capturing your sketch
- Screenshot tool

### Task
Create a dashboard layout that includes:
- Navigation sidebar
- Header with user profile
- Main content area with cards/widgets

Choose one of these use cases for your dashboard:

1. **Project Management Dashboard**
   - Task status overview
   - Team member workload
   - Upcoming deadlines
   - Project progress charts
   - Recent activity feed

2. **E-commerce Analytics**
   - Daily sales overview
   - Top-selling products
   - Customer acquisition metrics
   - Inventory status
   - Recent orders

3. **Fitness Tracking**
   - Daily activity summary
   - Workout statistics
   - Nutrition tracking
   - Goal progress
   - Upcoming workout schedule

4. **Personal Finance**
   - Account balances
   - Monthly spending breakdown
   - Budget tracking
   - Recent transactions
   - Savings goals

Pick the use case that interests you most - this will help you create more meaningful content for your wireframe and make the exercise more engaging.

### Steps

1. **Create Your Wireframe**
   - Draw a simple wireframe of your dashboard layout on paper
   - Include basic elements like navigation, header, and content areas
   - Take a clear photo of your wireframe

2. **Find Inspiration**
   - Choose a website whose design style you'd like to emulate
   - Take a screenshot of relevant parts
   - Note specific design elements you like (colors, typography, spacing)

3. **Generate the UI**
   - Upload both your wireframe and inspiration screenshot to v0
   - Write a prompt that describes:
     - The structure from your wireframe
     - The design elements from your inspiration
     - Any additional requirements

   Example prompt:
   ```
   Create a dashboard layout based on my wireframe sketch, but using the 
   design style from the screenshot. Match the color scheme, typography, 
   and overall polish of the inspiration, while maintaining the layout 
   structure I sketched. Include proper responsive behavior and 
   interactions.
   ```

4. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Review the generated component
   - Adjust your prompt to refine specific aspects
   - Try different variations

### Success Criteria
- The final UI should follow your wireframe's structure
- The design should reflect the style of your inspiration
- The component should be fully responsive
- Interactions (hover states, animations) should be polished
- The code should be clean and well-organized

### Tips
- Make your wireframe sketch clear and simple
- Choose inspiration that matches your desired complexity level
- Be specific in your prompts about which elements from the inspiration you want to incorporate
- Don't hesitate to iterate multiple times to get the desired result


## Additional Challenge

Try generating the same component with different style variations by using different inspiration screenshots. This will help you understand how v0 interprets and applies different design languages.
